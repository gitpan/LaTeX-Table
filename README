LaTeX-Table version 0.9.1

LaTeX::Table provides functionality for an intuitive and easy generation of
LaTeX tables. It ships with some predefined good looking table styles. This module s
upports multipage tables via the C<xtab> package and publication
quality tables with the C<booktabs> package. It also supports the C<tabularx>
package for nicer fixed-width tables. Furthermore, it supports the C<colortbl>
package for colored tables optimized for presentations.

LaTeX makes professional typesetting easy. Unfortunately,
this is not entirely true for tables. Many additional, highly specialized packages are 
therefore available on CTAN. This module supports the best packages and
visualizes your in Perl generated or summarized results with high quality.

    perl Build.PL

Now start the script generate_examples.pl in the examples directory of this
distibution.
